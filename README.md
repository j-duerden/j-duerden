- 👋 Hi, I’m James Duerden (@j-duerden), welcome to my portfolio!
- 👀 Inside you will find all of the projects I have worked on. Works done for organisations are viewable on my website at: https://jduerden96.wixsite.com/portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Unreal Engine content, as well as developing a new Unity project (though it is still in its design phase!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all Unity/C# projects. I specialise as a gameplay programmer, but also have VR development experience!
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an email at jduerden96@gmail.com!
